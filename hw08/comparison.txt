Comparison between Method 1(Mutex + Condition Variable) and Method 2(Semaphore)

1. Synchronization Mechanism
	- Mutex and Condition Variable
	Fine-grained control over shared resources and allows waiting and signaling explicitly.
	- Semaphore
	Simpler mechanism, but harder to implement complex synchronization logic

2. Use Case
	- Mutex and Condition Variable
	Suitable for scenarios where multiple threads require conditional waiting
	- Semaphore
	Works well for signaling or resource counting

3. Complexity
	- Mutex and Condition Variable
	Slightly more complex due to additional condition variable
	- Semaphore
	Easier to understand and implement in basic scenarios
